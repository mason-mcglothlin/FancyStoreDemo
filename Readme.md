This project is intended to be a demonstration of how to properly follow separation of concerns in a ASP.NET application, particularly Web Forms. A simple website that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods for objects is demonstrated.

Currently, any of the following storage mechanisms can be used:

 - In Memory
 - SQLite
 - Loose JSON files
 - MongoDB
 - RavenDb
 - Loose XML files
 - Oracle (untested)
 - MS SQL Server (planned)
 - MySQL (planned)
